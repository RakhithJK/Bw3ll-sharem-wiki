While SHAREMâ€™s emulation feature can deobfuscate encoded shellcode by emulating a decoder stub, SHAREM also possesses the capability to perform brute-force deobfuscation without emulation. This feature is useful when encountering obfuscated shellcode that is not able to be decoded via emulation and can use both parallel and distributed computing techniques to improve decoding efficiency. This can also be used to successfully deobfuscate, even if there is no decoder stub, although that is not likely. This feature can decode shellcodes obfuscated by using one or several keys to apply a bitwise operation to each byte. For example, each byte may be XORed by 0x62, incremented by 0x123, then XORed again by 0x99. To check whether a shellcode was successfully decoded, SHAREM searches for the PEB walking sequence in the potentially decoded bytes.

The brute-forcing menu can be accessed by typing _b_ at the main menu. If a decoder stub is available in the shellcode, the _s_ option will automatically detect it and select likely values and operations for fast decoding. The user simply needs to enter in the entry point of the shellcode, then confirm. For shellcodes with no decoder stub, the operation types to use during brute-forcing can be selected via the _o_ option. Although SHAREM supports up to 5 operations, increasing the amount above 3 will begin to significantly increase potential combinations and decoding times.

The _d_ option brings up a submenu of advanced brute-forcing options:
