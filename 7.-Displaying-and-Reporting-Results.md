## Print Menu

Once items have been discovered by SHAREM, a summary of everything found can be generated using the Print Menu, accessible by typing _p_ from the main menu. Here, each category of item can be toggled by typing _g_, then typing codes corresponding to each selection:

If the _j_ option is toggled on, SHAREM will generate useful JSON files that can be easily integrated with other tools. Printing style of emulation and artifacts can be altered as well via the _e_ and _m_ options. If output is excessively long, printing to screen can be disabled with _p_ and output can be parsed via the files created upon running the print feature with _z_.

The _s_ option corresponds to the “Windows Syscall” category of shellcode instructions. The option leads to the menu seen below, where the user can select which syscalls ID (System Service Number – SSN) sets are used. Since SSNs change between Windows OSs and release builds, the user should select those relevant to the environment(s) where the sample might typically be found.

Once the desired options are selected, the print feature can be executed by typing _z_. Reports of information such as annotated disassembly, shellcode instructions, JSON files, and more are saved to the _…/sharem/sharem/sharem/sharem/logs_ folder. If printing to screen is enabled, much of this information can be seen in the console as well.

This will utilize the well-known SSN .csv files available from https://github.com/j00ru/windows-syscalls and also displayed in a table at https://j00ru.vexillium.org/syscalls/nt/64/ SSNs often change for each release, so what is one syscall in one release, may be an entirely different syscall in another!
