## Shellcode Files

Analysis of “raw” shellcode files is also available and works similarly to PE files. Analysis of shellcode is the focal point of SHAREM. SHAREM accepts both true binary data and text files containing ASCII representations of opcodes such as the following:

To analyze “raw” files, use the -r32 flag instead of -pe. This will analyze the shellcode a 32-bit shellcode. If the file is 64-bit, use the -r64 flag to indicate this as SHAREM cannot automatically detect architecture without PE file headers. The -r option can be used to reflect the desired cpu architecture setting in the config file (32 or 64-bit).

Example commands:
- `python main.py -r32 sc_test.txt`
- `python main.py -r64 sc_test_64.bin`

Once the interface has been launched, the z option can be used to quickly perform many of SHAREM’s features. The z option will do all possible options and will utilize specific settings made in the config file, which automatically will set or unset options in the interface. Changes in the interface will also be reflected by typing z in the main menu.

For shellcode files, SHAREM can emulate shellcode instructions, and it will do so automatically when using the Z option. If the shellcode performs self-modification, that is an indicator of it deobfuscating itself, and  SHAREM will use the newly decoded shellcode to analyze.

The shellcode emulation process can also reveal additional information about WinAPI calls and Syscalls made by the sample.

The steps to save and display analysis information for “raw” files are the same as those for PE files: use the p option to open the Print Menu, then use the z option to print and save selections. The z option will not display all results for all possible features to the screen, but all will be used in the text file report and JSON file that are generated. That also includes disassembly of the shellcode, which identifies the APIs used.
