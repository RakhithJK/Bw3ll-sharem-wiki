## Shellcode Files

Analysis of “raw” shellcode files is also available and works similarly to PE files. Analysis of shellcode is the focal point of SHAREM. SHAREM accepts both true binary data and text files containing ASCII representations of opcodes such as the following:

To analyze “raw” files, use the -r32 flag instead of -pe. This will analyze the shellcode a 32-bit shellcode. If the file is 64-bit, use the -r64 flag to indicate this as SHAREM cannot automatically detect architecture without PE file headers. The -r option can be used to reflect the desired cpu architecture setting in the config file (32 or 64-bit).
