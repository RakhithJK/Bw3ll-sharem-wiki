HAREM can detect imported modules and functions inside PE files. While the _q_ and _z_ options automatically execute each of these features, they can all be individually executed and tweaked as well using their corresponding menu options. These options can also be selected and executed via the internal menus.

## Modules

The _m_ option at the main menu allows the user to find modules loaded by the sample. The user is presented with a submenu:

Option 1 only looks for modules in the IAT of the sample. The other options search deeper, looking for modules loaded by other modules. This feature allows the user to find all modules effectively loaded by the PE file, even if they are not loaded directly by the sample itself. When selecting #3, the options are often set according to InOrderModuleList, although these are found recursively with our custom function. It does seem that the order in this can vary slightly depending on the OS and release and unique settings, so there may not necessarily be a definitive InOrderModuleList for something that has numerous DLLs, as variation can exist. Another unique feature is that it will tell where the module came from – for instance, did it come from the IAT or another DLL’s IAT? We are not aware of another tool with that feature.

## Imports

Similarly, typing _e_ at the main menu brings the user to a submenu where they can print functions imported by the sample. As with many of the other submenus, the _z_ command executes the functionality, and discovered imports can be reset with _r_. Unusual imports could indicate malicious activity in a sample – for example, imports for networking capabilities in a simple video player may be worth investigating.
