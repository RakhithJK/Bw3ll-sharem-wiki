SHAREM is a shellcode analysis or malware analysis tool that utilizes emulation and static analysis techniques to provide useful information about a sample. Arguably emulation is static analysis, so we can obtain a tremendous wealth of information without ever executing the shellcode, emulating over 16,000 WinAPIs and 98% of user-mode Windows syscalls, and generating highly detailed reports (text file and JSON). It can be used to analyze raw samples of shellcode and additionally PE files.

Steps to quickly analyze a sample can be seen below.
