SHAREM can be used to detect suspicious sequences of instructions in both PE files and “raw” samples of assembly code. This is done purely through static analysis and without the use of emulation. These results can also be used to enrich the disassembly, so even these found will also show up as comments in the disassembly of the shellcode. Additionally, when SHAREM generates reports, it will generate a small, representative excerpt of disassembly for this particular instruction.

While occasionally coincidental, these sequences of instructions possible could indicate malicious sections of code within the sample. Some may or may not be related to shellcode, if found in a PE file. Not all may be known to a causal analyst, so identifying what these instructions mean – rather than having them be cryptic, unknown features – is another pragmatic feature.  When analyzing a sample, the user should typically enter this menu, choose the desired types of instructions to search for, then execute the search. Next, the user can display and save all discovered code snippets via the Print Menu accessible via p from the main menu.
